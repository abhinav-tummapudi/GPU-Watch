        <h1>Warning: Inefficient Utilization of GPU Resources on Hopper Cluster</h1>
        
        <p>$net_ID,</p>
        
	<p>Job $job_ID is using GPU resources inefficiently. The job has allocated a <strong>$gpu_allocated</strong> GPU on node <strong>$gpu_node</strong>, but the GPU is not being utilized within minimum usage guidelines. This impacts the availability of resources for other researchers.</p>
        
        <p>Please review and adjust your allocation settings to match the actual requirements of your workload.</p>
        
        <h4>Note: If no adjustments are made within the next 1 hours, your job will be automatically terminated to free up resources for other users.</h4>
        
        <p>For guidance on monitoring and optimizing your GPU utilization, please refer to our documentation at: <a href="https://wiki.orc.gmu.edu/mkdocs/Monitoring_GPU_Jobs/">Monitoring GPU Jobs</a>.</p>
        
        <p>If you need any assistance, please feel free to visit our walk-in office hours or contact us through <a href:"mailto:orchelp@gmu.edu">orchelp@gmu.edu</a>.</p>
